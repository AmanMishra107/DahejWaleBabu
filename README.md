## Overview

**DahejWaleBabu** is a satirical web-based tool aimed at bringing attention to the serious issue of dowry through humor and parody. It includes:

- **AI Face Analyzer** – A fictional tool that purports to analyze someone’s face for dowry suggestions.
- **Dowry Calculator** – A playful, randomly generated tool that calculates a dowry amount based on arbitrary criteria.

The intent is to use satire to provoke conversation about tradition, stereotypes, and social reform.
